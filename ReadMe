# Immune RTS Prototype

This repository hosts a prototype for a browser-based real-time strategy game where the human immune system mobilizes against invading pathogens. The first playable scenario simulates a common cold, focusing on the battle between immune defenders and the rhinovirus causing a runny nose.

## Gameplay Pillars
- **Two Factions**: Command innate and adaptive immune cells against waves of incoming viruses.
- **Resource Management**: Spend accumulating cellular mass to recruit units and trigger abilities.
- **Tactical Positioning**: Drop immune cells onto the tissue battlefield to intercept pathogens before they weaken the host.
- **Scenario-Driven Levels**: Each infection presents unique enemy compositions and win conditions.

## Level 1: Runny Nose
- **Objective**: Prevent the Rhinovirus swarm from overwhelming the nasal tissue before the infection meter fills up.
- **Enemy Waves**: Trickle of Rhinovirus particles backed by mucus clumps that block shots.
- **Victory**: Survive all pathogen waves; **Defeat**: Infection meter reaches 100% or pathogens breach the tissue line.

## Immune Units (Prototype)
| Unit | Cost (Cellular Mass) | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Macrophage | 30 | Slow melee bruiser that soaks damage and clears mucus.
| Neutrophil | 45 | Fast striker that charges viruses, great for burst damage.
| T Cell | 60 | Ranged specialist that fires antigen bolts from a distance.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in any modern desktop browser.
2. Click **Start Runny Nose** to initialize the scenario.
3. Spend cellular mass to deploy immune units near the left side of the battlefield.
4. Keep an eye on the infection meter and nasal tissue health bar.

## Roadmap Ideas
- Additional immune abilities (e.g., fever boost, antibody spray).
- Progressive campaign of escalating infections.
- Tech tree for unlocking advanced cells and upgrades.
- Audio/visual polish and accessibility tweaks.
